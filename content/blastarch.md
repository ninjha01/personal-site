##### **A blast service** must be performant and private.

> What is BLAST? When would I need it?

BLAST helps you find regions of biological sequence that resemble each other. It can help answer questions like "What viruses look similar to SARS-CoV2?" or "Are there any human genes that look like this mouse gene?".

> Why not use the NCBI blast tool?

The public NCBI tool only runs against public biological sequences, is relatively slow, and can be unintuitive to use. Many companies and institutions need a blast tool that is **private**, **fast**, and **easy to use** across all screen sizes.
