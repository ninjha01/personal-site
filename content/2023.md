## Annually Buffered

Default-alive usually refers to a startup that brings in enough revenue from their customers that they do not need to raise external money in order to keep the lights on.

As an indie developer, I achieved a similar status on April 1st. By that day, I had earned enough income in 2023 that if I did not make any more, it would not be a catastrophe. I call this being "Annually Buffered". I wouldn't be saving money or going on a vacation, but the rent would be paid and food would be on the table. It meant that I can be selective in who I worked for and at what rate.

## Github Accelerator

I was accepted into the inaugural Github Accelerator alongside Timothy Stiles and his project Poly. This program was incredible. Getting to learn from phenomenal developers whose work I use every day was a career highlight. I highly reccomend [applying](TODO FIND LINK)!
