Rockband events on github

sponsorship viz is _much_ more sparse

Africa still very dark. Europe

Software Development isnt about engineers anymore



I was lucky enough to be asked to attend Github Universe this year. It was my first tech conference, and it felt like grabbing a live wire. The keynote preshow was a mesmerizing visualization of real-time activity on Github. Rockband-style tracks of light pulsed and thrummed every time code was pushed, pulled, and reviewed on the platform.

Going into the main presentation I was awed by the sheer amount of code that was being written in the world, and felt really proud to be a developer.

Then the keynote started. [I've already written]() about how I think AI will affect software engineers (and [how they should respond]()). So I wasn't suprised when Copilot was the main focus of the talk.

I use copilot extensively - I believe Github when they say it makes dev's 55% better. And spreading those productivity gains outwards from the IDE into the broader github ecosystem is a reasonable, obvious idea.

But I was absolutely floored by this.

"Github started by building on top of git."
"Now we will be built on top of Copilot."

I started seeing double. My sweat froze. The complimentary sparkling water ran flat.

`git` is a symbol of the software I fell in love with. It's a powerful, [unapproachable](xkcd), [arcane](tao of git) tool that was built by [a wizard] and given to the world for free. It's a self-contained, modular tool that demands a lot of knowledge from the user, and pays it back in power and flexibility.

Copilot is a symbol of the next kind of software. It's a powerful, [eldritch](), force that has descended the gradient into our mortal plane, summoned by chanters who do not, can not, understand [the myriad numbers](weights) they inscribe. It's a sprawling, distributed system that asks for a (reasonable) amount of money, and pays it back in power and lock in.

And it's really that second part that gets me. I don't use Microsoft's (owner of Github) IDE. I use emacs (another powerful, unapproachable, arcane tool). Github


Embrace, Extend, Extinguish

Others have said "Don't forget to be afraid of Microsoft". I wasn't around to learn that lesson last time, but Microsoft is a generous teacher.
