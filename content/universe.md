# GitHub drops `git`
I was lucky enough to be asked to attend GitHub Universe this year. It was my first tech conference, and it felt like grabbing a live wire. The keynote pre-show was a mesmerizing visualization of real-time activity on GitHub. Rock Band-style tracks of light pulsed and thrummed every time code was pushed, pulled, and reviewed on the platform.

Going into the main presentation I was awed by the sheer amount of code that was being written in the world, and felt really proud to be a developer.

Then the keynote started. [I've already written](/essays/tower) about how I think AI will affect software engineers (and [how they should respond](/essays/squeeze)). So I wasn't surprised when Copilot was the main focus of the talk.

I use copilot extensively - I believe GitHub when they say it makes devs 55% better. And spreading those productivity gains outwards from the IDE into the broader github ecosystem is a reasonable, obvious idea.

But I was absolutely floored by this.

"GitHub was founded on git. Today, it's re-founded on Copilot"

My sweat froze. The complimentary sparkling water ran flat.

`git` is a symbol of the software I fell in love with. It's a powerful, [unapproachable](https://xkcd.com/1597/), [arcane](https://stevelosh.com/blog/2013/04/git-koans/) tool that was built by [a wizard](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/10-years-of-git-an-interview-with-git-creator-linus-torvalds) and given to the world for free. It's a self-contained, modular tool that demands a lot of knowledge from the user, and pays it back in power and flexibility.

Copilot is a harbinger of the next kind of software. It's a powerful, [eldritch](https://twitter.com/anthrupad/status/1622349563922362368), force that has descended the gradient into our mortal plane, summoned forth by chanters who do not understand it. It's a sprawling, distributed system that asks for a (reasonable) amount of money, and pays it back in power and vendor lock-in.

I don't use Microsoft's (owner of GitHub) IDE. I use emacs (another powerful, unapproachable, arcane tool). And GitHub does provide a binary that lets my emacs interface with Copilot. For now.

"Back in the 1990s Silicon Valley was terrified of Microsoft; then, over the intervening years, that fear faded, and Microsoft became yesterdayâ€™s news at best, and the punchline of jokes at worse." (from [Stratechery](https://stratechery.com/2023/microsoft-office-ai-copilot-and-techs-two-philosophies-business-chat-and-appropriate-fear/))

I wasn't around to feel that fear back in the 90s. But I feel it now.
