Nitro is a quick, private, and intuitive system to find similar regions across DNA, RNA, or Protein sequences. Built on top of the NCBI **B**asic **L**ocal **A**lignment **S**earch **T**ool (BLAST), Nitro lets you run secure searches against your proprietary sequences.

> What is BLAST? When would I need it?

BLAST helps you find regions of biological sequence that resemble each other. It can help answer questions like "What viruses look similar to SARS-CoV2?" or "Are there any human genes that look like this mouse gene?".

> Why not use the NCBI blast tool?

The public NCBI tool only runs against public biological sequences, is relatively slow, and can be unintuitive to use. Nitro is **private**, **fast**, and **easy to use** across all screen sizes.

> Why not run blast myself?

This can be a good option if you have the resources to deploy, maintain, and troubleshoot a piece of software that may not be core to your business. With Nitro, you offload those costs and get a more performant and pleasant to use tool that **lets you get back to producing ground-breaking science**.
