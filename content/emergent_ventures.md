I pursued a career in medicine until my junior year of college, when I earned a very good score on the MCAT. The long years of medical education ahead of me suddenly became real - 10 more years before I could be independent and make an impact! It was too steep a price.

Alongside my pre-med courses, I majored in Computer Science for rather mercernary reasons - to help me stand out in medical school admissions. But like a Hallmark movie, I genuinely fell in love with the field. I vividly remember the moment I grokked Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and the Code/Data isomorphism.

Aside from the domain, I learned two guiding principles. First, that I could move much faster than what beauracracies expected. I finished my undergraduate coursework a year early and took graduate classes, ultimately compressing 6 years of coursework into 4 and earning both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in CS.

I also learned I could make things that were immediately useful to others. I worked in a lab studying pancreatic cancer. I was lousy at benchwork, but I wrote simple data analysis tools that saved the lab tech I worked with several hours per week.

Having decided against medical school, I wish I had immediately pursued a career that synthesized CS and Life Science, but the truth is that I took a well-paying job at a bank. This was a costly mistake - I was miserable and unproductive. I left after a year, with strong evidence that I belonged at the intersection of software and biology.

I got back on track by moving to Boston and working in the Cancer Data Science team at the Broad Institute. I was much more productive, and some of the work I did there was accepted into Nature Genetics! More importantly, I learned that I wanted my career to serve life scientists. Not just because my skillset was helpful - but also because I greatly enjoy the culture and ethos of scientific research.

I then worked at a startup to learn how to get a small business off the ground, at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to learn how to lead a technical team, and most recently started a biotech software consultancy to reify those lessons into experience.

Running a consultancy solo is difficult, especially as a solo founder responsible for both the business and technical work. But it makes sure my vision and skills continue to make contact with reality and stay honest.

My path has shown me that programming talent is potent, but incentives can cause it to flow to sub-optimal places where it is less useful on the margin. If funneled into Life Science research, it can have a disproportinal, bi-directional impact. Life Science might not even be getting the better deal! Valuable and expensive talent would flow from Software, but a vigorous cultural infusion from the research side could easily have a more powerful effect.

I think it is very good to be kind. Kindness is a de rigueur theme of children's books, which are charmingly pure distillations of consensus viewpoints. It is also a consensus viewpoint in a different sense - Generous Tit for Tat is a strong approach to iterated Prisoner's Dillemas. The cliche has borne out for me - kindness often rebounds upon the giver.

Working at the intersection of two deeply technical domains gives me many opportunities to give and recieve kindness. Effectively explaining a complex topic to an intelligent but uninformed counterparty requires a certain generosity of spirit.

Emergent Ventures also strikes me as a remarkably kind grant program. The money is obviously helpful - but I expect the psychological effects of being selected are a stronger, more sustained boon. So not only is it a broadly consensus view, but I suspect that you and I share it in particular.

The culture of software engineering should be re-invograted. Talent is languishing, pooling in lucrative but un-impactful places - just like I was at my bank job. Burnout is increasing as a "rest and vest" culture is taking root. Employees phone in their work and collect a paycheck for as long as they can. I see this happening broadly on forums, blogs, and youtube videos.

All the while Life Science badly needs engineering skill. I often am asked to help reproduce an analysis or pipeline described in a paper, but am stymied by the lack of documentation. A lot of work is sloppily conducted for lack of knowledge and ergonomic tooling. To address these issues, I want to build a strong community at the intersection of software and biology.

For the past year, I've been working on Bits in Bio (BiB) - a remote community that connects engineers and life scientists. Concretely, I work on open source software tools to make life science software better, run surveys to make the community more legible to it's members and potential sponsors, and engage with members online.

To support myself, I run a biotech software consultancy . It is successful enough that I can sustainably devote a third of my time to BiB. Even without Emergent Ventures support, I am on the path to bootstrapping BiB. We have 4,000 members in our slack community, a job board with 86 active postings from biotech companies (and 125 closed), and 23,555 visits to our landing page in the last 12 months.

An Emergent Ventures grant would accelerate this bootstrapping process by funding media content and software development. On the media side, I plan to write a series of essays introducing biological concepts through a computer science lens and vice versa. This follows the example of Paul Graham, Hacker News, and YC. His essays served as the nucleation point for a strong community and impactful business. The funding required for this would be fairly low (~$5000) to cover living expenses. I will also springboard the essays into a podcast. Like Ben Thompson's Stratechery, I would start by recording audio versions of the essays. This would give me an audio project to learn the basics of, which will make it easier to launch a more accessible and engaging show with a co-host like Sharp Tech. For equipment, software, and the time to learn this new skill I estimate needing ~$10,000 in grant funding.

On the software development side, there is a strong need for better frontend tools. Many scientists learn how to use backend technologies like R and python to perform analyses, but aren't proficient at writing software with interactivity and good UI/UX.

I have already developed an open source data visualization software for synthetic biology called Nitro UI. It recieved $7000 in funding from GitHub and launched successfully. It is currently being used at the Alphabet longevity research company Calico Labs and the plasmid sequencing company Plasmidsaurus. I would like to expand the library out of the synthetic biology domain to be more broadly applicable to life scientists by building out a sophisticated plotting software. I estimate this to take ~$20,000 in funding.

Via my consultancy, I have a strong network of clients who would be able to financially sustain the community via paying for advertising on content, paying for access to our job board, or sponsoring the annual survey I run. I do not expect to need ongoing support.
