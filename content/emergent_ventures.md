Growing up, I wanted to practice medicine because I liked science. I pursued this career unthinkingly until my junior year of college, when I earned a very good score on the MCAT. The long years of medical education ahead of me suddenly became real - 10 more years before I could be independent and make an impact! It was too steep a price.

Alongside my pre-med courses, I majored in Computer Science. I had enjoyed computers from a young age, but I picked the degree for rather mercernary reasons - to help me stand out in medical school admissions. But like a Hallmark movie, I genuinely fell in love with the field. I vividly remember the moment I grokked Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and the Code/Data isomorphism.

Aside from the domain, I learned two guiding principles. First, that I could move much faster than what beauracracies expected. I finished my undergraduate coursework a year early and took graduate classes, ultimately compressing 6 years of coursework into 4 and earning both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in CS. 

I also learned I could make things that were immediately useful to others. I worked in a lab studying pancreatic cancer. I was lousy at benchwork, but I wrote some simple data analysis tooling that saved my the lab tech several hours per week.

Having decided against medical school, I wish I had immediately pursued a career that synthesized CS and Life Science, but the truth is that I took a well-paying job at a bank. This was a costly mistake - I was miserable and unproductive. I left after a year, with strong evidence that I belonged at the intersection of software and biology.

I got back on track by moving to Boston and working in the Cancer Data Science team at the Broad Institute. I was much more productive, and some of the work I did there was accepted into Nature Genetics! More importantly, I learned that I wanted my career to serve life scientists. Not just because my skillset was helpful - but also because I greatly enjoy the culture and ethos of scientific research. I get the sense programmers had a similar striving culture, but that it has become dilute in recent years.

I then worked at a startup to learn how to get a small business off the ground, at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to learn how to lead a technical team, and most recently started a biotech software consultancy to reify those lessons into experience.

Running a consultancy solo is difficult, especially as a solo founder responsible for both the business and technical work. But it makes sure my vision and skills continue to make contact with reality and stay honest.

My path has shown me that programming talent is powerful, but incentives can cause it to flow to sub-optimal places where it is less useful on the margin. If funneled into Life Science research, it can have a disproportinal, bi-directional impact. Life Science might not even be getting the better deal! Valuable and expensive talent would flow from Software, but a vigorous cultural infusion from the research side could easily be more impactful.

I think it is very good to be kind. Kindness is a de rigueur theme of children's books, which are charmingly pure distillations of consensus viewpoints. It is also a consensus viewpoint in a different sense - Generous Tit for Tat is a strong approach to iterated Prisoner's Dillemas. And the cliche has borne out for me - kindness often rebounds upon the giver. 

Working at the intersection of two deeply technical domains gives me many opportunities to give and recieve kindness. Effectively explaining a complex topic to an intelligent but uninformed counterparty requires a certain generosity of spirit.

Emergent Ventures also strikes me as a remarkably kind grant program. The money is obviously helpful - but I expect the psychological effects of being selected are a stronger, more sustained boon. So not only is it a broadly consensus view, but I suspect that you and I share it in particular.

> Clearer Problem Statement:

> While you mention the need for software skills in life science, it would be helpful to define this problem more clearly. What specific challenges in life science research can be addressed with better software? Providing a clear problem statement makes it easier for readers to understand the necessity and impact of your project.

The culture of software engineering should be re-invograted. Talent is languishing, pooling in lucrative but un-impactful places - just like I was at my bank job. I see this happening broadly. Burnout is increasing while employees "rest and vest" - phone in their work and collect a paycheck for as long as they can.
> TODO: connect burnout and "rest and vest" better

All the while Life Science badly needs engineering skill. I often am asked to help reproduce an analysis or pipeline, but am stymied by the lack of documentation. A lot of work is sloppily conducted for lack of knowledge and ergonomic tooling. To address these issues, I want to build a strong community at the intersection of software and biology.

For the past year, I've been working on Bits in Bio (BiB) - a remote community that connects engineers and life scientists. Concretely, I work on open source software tools to make life science software better, run surveys to make the community more legible to it's members and potential sponsors, and engage with members online.

I run a biotech software consultancy to support myself. It is successful enough that I can sustainably devote a third of my time to BiB. Even without Emergent Ventures support, BiB is on the path to bootstrapping itself. However, a grant would dramatically accelerate this process by funding 1) an in-person Pasadena chapter, 2) Content to bring in Engineering talent, and 3) Badly needed software tools.


the bootstraping of this community by freeing me up to write evergreen content that attracts and onboards talent, invest in building out in-person BiB communities, and write badly needed software tools.



> Detailed Plans for BiB:

> Expand on your plans for Bits in Bio (BiB). What specific types of evergreen content, software tools, or community-building activities do you plan to implement? More detailed plans can make your proposal feel more tangible and executable.

> Broader Impact and Scalability:

> Discuss the broader impact of your project. How do you envision scaling it? What is the long-term vision or end goal? This can help demonstrate the sustainability and wider relevance of your idea.

> Feedback and Learning:

> Mention any feedback or learning experiences you've had while working on BiB or during your consultancy. This shows adaptability and a commitment to continuous improvement.

Via my consultancy, I have a strong network of clients who would be able to financially sustain the community via paying for advertising on content, paying for access to our job board, or sponsoring the annual survey I run. I do not expect to need ongoing support once bootstrapped.

> Enhanced Financial Projection:

> A brief but more detailed financial projection or budget for the grant could be included. How exactly would the funds be allocated? This shows that you've thought through the practical aspects of your project in detail.
