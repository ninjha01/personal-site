I pursued a career in medicine until my junior year of college, when I earned a very good score on the MCAT. The long years of medical education ahead of me suddenly became real - I would have to wait 10 more years before I could be independent and make an impact! It was too steep a price.

Alongside my pre-med courses, I majored in Computer Science for rather mercernary reasons - to help me stand out in medical school admissions. But like a Hallmark movie, I genuinely fell in love with the field. I vividly remember the moment I grokked Godel's Incompleteness Theorem and the Code/Data isomorphism. And to this day it suprises me that the fundamental flaws Turing and Gödel found in Math and CS don't have bigger consequences.

Aside from the domain, I learned two guiding principles. First, that I could move much faster than what beauracracies expected. I finished my undergraduate coursework a year early and took graduate classes, ultimately compressing 6 years of coursework into 4 and earning both Bachelor's and Master's degrees in CS.

I also learned I could make things that were immediately useful to others. I worked in a lab studying pancreatic cancer. I was lousy at benchwork, but I wrote simple data analysis tools that saved the lab tech I worked with several hours per week.

Having decided against medical school, I wish I had immediately pursued a career that synthesized CS and Life Science, but the truth is that I took a well-paying job at a bank. This was a costly mistake - I was miserable and unproductive. I left after a year, with strong evidence that I belonged at the intersection of software and biology.

I got back on track by moving to Boston and working in the Cancer Data Science team at the Broad Institute. I was much more productive, and some of the work I did there was accepted into Nature Genetics! More importantly, I learned that my career should serve life scientists. Not just because my skillset was helpful - but also because I greatly enjoy the culture and ethos of scientific research.

I then worked at a startup to learn how to get a small business off the ground, at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to learn how to lead a technical team, and most recently started a biotech software consultancy to reify those lessons into experience.

Running a consultancy solo is difficult, especially as a solo founder responsible for both the business and technical work. But it makes sure my vision and skills continue to make contact with reality and stay honest.

My path has shown me that programming talent is potent, but incentives can cause it to flow to sub-optimal places where it is less useful on the margin. If funneled into Life Science research, it can have a disproportinal, bi-directional impact. Life Science might not even be getting the better deal! Valuable and expensive talent would flow from Software, but a vigorous cultural infusion from the research side could easily have a more powerful effect.

I think it is very good to be kind. Kindness is a de rigueur theme of children's books, which are charmingly pure distillations of consensus viewpoints. It is also a consensus viewpoint in a different sense - Generous Tit for Tat is a strong approach to iterated Prisoner's Dillemas. The cliche has borne out for me - kindness often rebounds upon the giver.

Working at the intersection of two deeply technical domains gives me many opportunities to give and recieve kindness. Effectively explaining a complex topic to an intelligent but uninformed counterparty requires a certain generosity of spirit.

Emergent Ventures also strikes me as a remarkably kind grant program. The money is obviously helpful - but I expect the psychological effects of being selected are a stronger, more sustained boon. So not only is it a broadly consensus view, but I suspect that you and I share it in particular.

The culture of software engineering should be re-invograted. Talent is languishing, pooling in lucrative but un-impactful places - just like I was at my bank job. Burnout is increasing as a "rest and vest" culture is taking root. Employees phone in their work and collect a paycheck for as long as they can. I see this happening broadly on forums, blogs, and youtube videos.

All the while Life Science badly needs engineering skill. I often am asked to help reproduce an analysis or pipeline described in a paper, but am stymied by the lack of documentation. A lot of work is sloppily conducted for lack of knowledge and ergonomic tooling. To address these issues, I want to build a strong community at the intersection of software and biology.

For the past year, I've been working on Bits in Bio (BiB) - a remote community that connects engineers and life scientists. Concretely, I work on open source software tools to make life science software better, run surveys to make the community more legible to it's members and potential sponsors, and engage with members online. Even without Emergent Ventures support, the community is growing. We have 4,000 members in our slack community, a job board with 86 active postings from biotech companies (and 125 closed), and 23,555 visits to our landing page in the last 12 months.

But an Emergent Ventures grant would enable the creation of a new program that would pair interested software engineers with top life science research labs. These engineers would work with a lab for a summer, learning about their software needs and seeing how research is conducted firsthand. 

Specifically, I'd start by leveraging the existing BiB and Nitro Bio network and approach promising labs/PIs. The labs will be asked for software project proposals that can be executed during a 3 month summer program. These projects will be evaluated and a "bounty" will be created according to feasibility, impact, and scope. Each selected project will be detailed in a public write-up that provides information on its objective, expected impact, and the skills required to execute it. This will not just help us match engineers to projects, but also raise awareness of unmet technical needs in the life sciences. These writeups will be shared in the Bits in Bio community, and interested engineers will go through a fast (1 day turn-around) technical interview process. Once the candidates are selected, I'll coordinate with labs and candidates to ensure a smooth onboarding. This will include setting up lines of communication and defining schedules, status checkpoints, and expectations. The program will have a weekly cadence to track and monitor progress between the lab, software engineer, and Bits in Bio. Progress and insights from the program will be documented in blog posts on Bits in Bio. Software that shows potential for wider use will be made open-source under the Bits in Bio label. In addition to fostering transparency, this will also serve to attract future engineers and labs to our program.

I already develop and maintain an open source data visualization software for synthetic biology called Nitro UI. It recieved $7000 in funding from GitHub, which is a sign that ambitious open source projects can get further support. Via my consultancy, I have a strong network of clients like Calico Labs (Alphabet's longevity research company), and Arcadia Sciences (FRO funded by Sam Altman) who could financially sustain the program via sponsoring a cohort, paying a recruiting fee. I do not expect ongoing support from Emergent Ventures.

The major cost for this program will be paying stipends for software engineers, roughly $10k/person. Starting with a small cohort of 3 people, I expect this program to cost on the order of $30,000. If there is more funding, I would like to purchase my own time for ~6 months for an additional $30,000. If that isn't available, I would continue to run my consultancy on the side which would take time away from the program but would sustain me until the program takes off.
