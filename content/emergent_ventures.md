--- Chat GPT feedback ---

our application to Tyler Cowen's Emergent Ventures grant program provides a good overview of your background, achievements, and the mission of Bits in Bio (BiB). However, there are areas where it could be improved to make a stronger impact. Here are some constructive feedback points:

Personal Story and Motivation: Your journey from a potential medical career to software engineering in biotech is interesting, but it's important to more clearly connect your personal story to your current mission. Emphasize how your experiences have uniquely positioned you to lead BiB, and why this matters to you personally.

Clarity on Impact: While you mention the importance of kindness and the need for software engineering talent in life sciences, it would be beneficial to further clarify the specific impact BiB has had so far. Provide concrete examples or metrics, if available, to demonstrate the effectiveness of your approach.

Details on Future Plans: You mention your plans to grow the BiB community, develop software tools, and write content. Elaborate on these plans. What specific tools are you planning to build? What type of content will you write? How will these actions contribute to your overall mission?

Financial Justification: Explain why the grant is critical for your project. What specific activities or resources will the grant fund? How will this funding make a difference in your ability to achieve your goals?

Measurable Goals: Set clear, measurable objectives for what you aim to achieve with the grant. This could include targets for community growth, software tool development timelines, or content publication schedules.

Professional Tone: While the personal touch is important, ensure the tone remains professional. Phrases like "podunk Virginia" might detract from the overall professionalism of the application.

Addressing Potential Weaknesses: If there are any potential concerns or weaknesses in your application (such as the shift from banking to biotech), proactively address them. Explain how these experiences contribute to your broader perspective and skill set.

Longer version:
Growing up, I wanted to practice medicine because I liked science, being good at science, and because adults approved of the goal. In my junior year of college, I earned a 97th percentile score on the MCAT. The long years of additional education ahead of me were suddenly reified by this good score - and their price was too steep. Along with my pre-med courses, I had finished the Computer Science degree program (in a compressed 3 years). I wish I had immediately pursued a career that synthesized CS and Medicine, but the truth is that I took a well-paying job at a bank. I stuck it out for a painful year, but thankfully got back on track by working at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Part of the work I did there is published in Nature Genetics. I then worked at a startup to learn the basics of running a business, at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to learn how to lead a technical team, and opened a biotech software consultancy last year to improve the tools available to software scientists.

Growing up in podunk Virginia, I aspired to be a doctor due to my aptitude in science. As a junior, I scored highly on the MCAT and concurrently completed a Computer Science degree in three years. Rather than pursue medicine, or a fusion of my interests, I regretfully chose a lucrative banking job. I soon course corrected, shifting to the Broad Institute where my work was published in Nature Genetics. Subsequent roles at a biotech startup, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's Infectious Disease team, and my own biotech software consultancy taught me more about the domain, business basics and leading a technical team.

I think being kind is very important. It is a de rigueur theme of children's books, signifying it's consensus status. It gets short shrift in early adulthood, but ultimately it is my highest-yield value.

Software engineering talent is languishing, pooling in lucrative but un-impactful places - just like I was at my bank job. I help run Bits in Bio (BiB) - a remote community that connects engineers and life scientists. Life Science badly needs engineering skill - a lot of work is sloppily conducted for lack of knowledge and ergonomic software.

I run a consultancy so I can build free and open software tools for BiB while supporting myself. A grant would let me focus full-time on growing this community by building out an in-person BiB community in Pasadena, write badly needed software tools, and writing content to attract and onboard talent.
