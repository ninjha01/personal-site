Growing up, I wanted to practice medicine because I liked science. I pursued this career unthinkingly until my junior year of college, when I earned a very good score on the MCAT. The long years of medical education ahead of me suddenly reified - 10 more years before I could be independent and make an impact! It was too steep a price.

Along with my pre-med courses, I majored in Computer Science for rather mercernary reasons. I thought it would help me stand out in medical school admissions. As these things often go, I fell in love with the field. Aside from the domain, I learned two guiding principles. First, that I could move much faster than what beauracracies expected. I finished the degree a year early and entered the graduate program compressing 6 years of coursework into 4 and earning a Bachelor's and Master's. I also learned I could make things that were immediately useful to others. I worked in a lab studying pancreatic cancer. I was lousy at benchwork, but I wrote some simple data analysis tooling that made the entire lab more efficient.

Having decided against medical school, I wish I had immediately pursued a career that synthesized CS and Life Science, but the truth is that I took a well-paying job at a bank. This was a costly mistake - I was miserable and unproductive. I left after a year, with strong evidence that I belonged at the intersection of software and biology.

I got back on track by moving to Boston and working in the Cancer Data Science team at the Broad Institute. There, I learned that I wanted my career to serve life scientists. I was much more productive, and some of the work I did there was accepted into Nature Genetics. I then worked at a startup to learn how to get a small business off the ground, at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to learn how to lead a technical team, and most recently opened a biotech software consultancy last year to improve the tools available to life scientists.

My path has shown me that programming talent is powerful, but incentives can cause it to flow to sub-optimal places where it is less useful on the margin. If funneled into Life Science research, it can have a disproportinal impact.

I think it is very good to be kind. Kindness is a de rigueur theme of children's books, which are charmingly pure distillations of consensus viewpoints. But the cliche has borne out for me - kindness often rebounds upon the giver. It is also a consensus viewpoint in a different sense - Generous Tit for Tat is a strong solution to iterated Prisoner's Dillemas.

Software engineering talent is languishing, pooling in lucrative but un-impactful places - just like I was at my bank job. Life Science badly needs engineering skill - a lot of work is sloppily conducted for lack of knowledge and ergonomic software.

I want to build a community at the intersection of software and biology. For the past year, I've been working on Bits in Bio (BiB) - a remote community that connects engineers and life scientists. Concretely, I work on open source software tools to make life science software better, run surveys to make the community more legible to it's members and potential sponsors, and engage with members online.

To support myself, I run a biotech software consultancy. It is successful enough such that I can sustainably devote a third of my time to BiB.

A grant would accelerate the bootstraping of this community by freeing me up to write evergreen content that attracts and onboards talent, invest in building out in-person BiB communities, and write badly needed software tools.

Via my consultancy, I have a strong network of clients who would be able to financially sustain the community via paying for advertising on content, paying for access to our job board, or sponsoring the annual survey I run. I do not expect to need ongoing support once bootstrapped.
